'''
Write a version of a palindrome recognizer that also accepts phrase palindromes such as 
"Go hang a salami I'm a lasagna hog.", "Was it a rat I saw?", "Step on no pets", "Sit on a potato pan, Otis",
"Lisa Bonet ate no basil", "Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas", "I roamed under it as a tired nude Maori",
"Rise to vote sir", or the exclamation "Dammit, I'm mad!". 
Note that punctuation, capitalization, and spacing are usually ignored.
