'''
Define a simple "spelling correction" function correct() that takes a string and sees to it that 
	1) two or more occurrences of the space character is compressed into one, and 
	2) inserts an extra space after a period if the period is directly followed by a letter. 
E.g. correct("This   is  very funny  and    cool.Indeed!") should return "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!"
Tip: Use regular expressions!

import re

def correct(x):
    x =x.replace('.', '. ')
    x = re.sub(' +', ' ', x)
    print x    

correct ("This   is  very funny  and           cool.Indeed!")
